- Dad had the idea to have an app that would let him track his car maintenance.

- Could be used for multiple cars
- Could send emails to user to alert them to upcoming maintenance
- Have ability to add different things to track.
- Include repair/price history?
- User can choose how early they are emailed about the upcoming maintenance.
